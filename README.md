# 🎶 Cellular Automata Meets Algorithmic Music: Generating Tunes from Math Rules

What happens when you let **mathematical chaos compose music**?

This project explores a creative crossover between **elementary cellular automata (CA)** and **algorithmic music generation**. Using simple 1D CA rules like **Rule 30**, **Rule 90**, and others, we create evolving binary patterns — and **sonify** them into melodies, rhythms, and textures.

## 🔍 Overview

- **Cellular Automata (CA):** A discrete model consisting of a grid of cells evolving through simple rules.
- **Music Mapping:** CA binary patterns are mapped to musical notes, beats, or instrument triggers.
- **Objective:** Demonstrate how emergent patterns from simple logic can produce **structured, sometimes surprising music**.

## ✨ Features

- 📜 Select from multiple CA rules (e.g., Rule 30, Rule 90, Rule 110).
- 🎼 Convert cell states into MIDI notes or synthesized sounds.
- 🔄 Animate CA generations and playback audio in sync.
- 📊 Visualize both CA evolution and musical score.
- 💾 Export to `.wav` or `.mid` formats.

## 🧠 Concept Behind the Project

This project demonstrates:
- How **mathematical rules** can generate complex behaviors.
- A unique approach to **algorithmic composition**.
- Use of **emergent computation** in the arts.

Cellular automata are deterministic, yet they can mimic randomness and structure — making them ideal for generative creativity.
